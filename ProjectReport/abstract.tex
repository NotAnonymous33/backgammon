This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a modern, web-based , client-server backgammon platform. The core objective was to create a system where multiple clients, controlled by either humans or artificial intelligence (AI), could connect to a central server and play against each other. The server, developed using Python with Flask, manages all game logic, including dice rolls, move validation, and state updates, ensuring consistent rule enforcement. A web-based client was developed using React and TypeScript, featuring an interactive SVG based board for human players. The system employs sockets in order to send and receive data between the client and server in real-time.  

A key motivation is that many current backgammon clients suffer from outdated designs and lack the modern user interface features found in other online gaming platforms. This project addresses these limitations by providing a more modern interface.

Key achievements include the successful implementation of this client-server architecture supporting human vs human, human vs AI, and AI vs AI game configurations. Furthermore, multiple distinct AI agents were developed, each implementing different strategies such as rule-based heuristics, Monte Carlo Tree Search, and neural networks trained using reinforcement learning.
