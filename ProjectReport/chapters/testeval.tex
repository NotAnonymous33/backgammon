\chapter{Testing and Evaluation}
This chapter describes the testing and evaluation of the backgammon platform, covering both client and AI performance.
\section{Game Testing}
\paragraph{Unit testing}
Core game logic (e.g. move generation, dice handling, board updates) were validated using a suite of Python \texttt{unittest} cases. 
Each rule regarding movement, such as hitting, bearing off, and re-entry, each had multiple test cases, ensuring 100\% test coverage for game logic. 
Edge cases, such as forced passes (where a player is unable to move and gives up their turn) and forced moves, were also explicitly covered in the test cases.

\paragraph{Integration Testing}
Client-server interactions were tested using Selenium scripts which executed the following tasks:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Create, join, and rejoin games via REST API;
    \item Establish socket connections and simulate human and AI players;
    \item Spectate AI vs AI games.
\end{enumerate}
Network interruptions and attempts to bypass client-side validation by sending requests directly to the server verified that the server emits appropriate errors.
